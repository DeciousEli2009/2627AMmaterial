'''
    functions are abstraction
    define functions(what is needed to run it):
        do this algorithm
then you call your function.

(x,y)
f(f)
fun()

'''


x=9
y=5
def add(x,y):
    print(x+y)

add(x,y) #positional arguments
add(4,4) #first arg is the x and the next is y
add  (2,2) #apparently this is okay?? Do not do this tho. Older versions of python dont do this and also its bad practice for other langs. Not to mention this looks os ugly
add("2","2")
add([1,2],[3,4])


def sub(x,y): #Local variables
    print(x-y)

def subtract(x,y):
    print(x-y)

def minus(a,b):
    print(a-b)

#this just multiplies the two input variables

def mandm(red,green): #PLEASE name your functions appropiately
    print(red*green)

mandm(2,8)
mandm("6",7)

General rules of thumbs
    1. name things appropriately - f() are usually verbs
    2. comments will save you later in life. Dont let your code speak for itself. Somebody may not understand
    3. get rid of the complexity. KISS (Keep it stupid simple!)
    4. Dont start with the function, build the algo then refine it into a function. As in look for repearing code you want dry code. Dont Repeat Yourself.
